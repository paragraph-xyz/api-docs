# **Manage account**

Keep your login method and connected wallet up to date.

Where to find it: Avatar in top-right corner → [Account Settings → Account](https://paragraph.com/settings/account/account).

After creating an account, you can manage your account, including the ability to:

- **Change your login email.** Click **Change email**, enter a new address, and confirm.
- **Connect a wallet** for passwordless login and wallet-delivery of posts. Click **Connect wallet** and follow the prompt. (You can keep both email and wallet on the same account.)
- **Delete your account** (irreversible). This permanently removes your account and **all** publications, posts, and subscribers associated with it. Use this only if you’re sure.

<Warning>
  Deleting your account is irreversible, so make sure you want to do it.\
  \
  If you want to remove duplicate posts, you can delete all the posts associated with your account in publication settings on the [import/export tab](/publish/export).
