Your profile details appear on your author profile, on your posts, and whenever someone hovers over your profile pic across the Paragraph product.

**Where to find these settings:** Avatar in top-right corner → [****Settings → Author****](https://paragraph.com/settings/account/author).

**Fields:**

- **Name** – shown on your posts.
- **Bio** – up to **500 characters**; a short description that appears on your profile.
- **Profile photo** – upload a square image (recommended **400 × 400 px**).
