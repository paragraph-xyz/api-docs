# Main areas in Paragraph

As you get started, here are the main areas you’ll use most in Paragraph.

### **Discovery feeds**

Paragraph makes it easy for readers to find great writing through two main feeds:

- [**For you**](https://paragraph.com/home) — personalized recommendations based on subscriptions and activity, showing posts from the people readers follow along with writing they’re likely to enjoy.

- [**Explore**](https://paragraph.com/explore) — readers can browse **Most popular** to see which recent posts have the most support or switch to **Newly published** to catch the latest writing.
