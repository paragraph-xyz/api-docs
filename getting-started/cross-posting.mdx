# **Cross-posting your newsletter**

Cross-posting makes it easy to bring your existing newsletter onto Paragraph **without moving platforms or subscribers**. Connect your publication’s RSS feed once, and every new post you publish elsewhere will automatically appear on Paragraph.

## **Why cross-post?**

- **Reach more readers** — Your posts appear on Paragraph, are delivered to Paragraph subscribers by email and wallet, and surface in discovery feeds.
- **Tap into Farcaster** — Once shared, posts load instantly in the Paragraph mini app, where readers can subscribe, collect, and comment right in the feed.
- **Unlock new monetization** — Crossposted posts can be collected with coins and remixed, letting readers support and spread your work in ways that aren’t possible on other platforms.

## **How it works**

1. Go to your Paragraph **Publication Settings → Auto-Crosspost**.
2. Paste in your newsletter’s RSS feed and click **Connect**.
3. Every new post you publish on your existing platform will automatically:
   - Publish to your Paragraph publication
   - Send to your Paragraph subscribers via email and wallet
   - Be eligible for minting, coins, and remixing
   - Appear across Paragraph discovery surfaces

You can edit, hide, or delete any crossposted post at any time, and it’s just as easy to turn off the connection.

## **Supported platforms**

Cross-posting works with any platform that supports RSS, including:

- Substack
- Beehiiv
- Ghost
- Medium
- WordPress
- And more

## **What’s next**

At launch, you’ll need to manually share crossposted posts to Farcaster. Soon, writers who sign in with Farcaster will be able to grant write permissions so crossposted posts automatically publish into the social feed for maximum visibility.
