# **Cross-posting your newsletter**

Cross-posting makes it easy to bring your existing newsletter onto Paragraph without having to switch platforms or having to import your posts and subscribers. Connect your publication’s RSS feed once and every new post you publish will automatically appear on Paragraph.

## **Why cross-post?**

- **Reach more readers** — your posts appear on Paragraph's discovery feeds and are delivered to readers that subscribe to your newsletter on Paragraph.
- **Reach more readers through our Farcaster mini app** — once shared, your posts load instantly in the Paragraph mini app, where readers can subscribe, support, and comment right in their feed.
- **Unlock new monetization** — by crossposting, you open up new ways for readers to back your work and share it more widely.

## **How it works**

1. Go to your Paragraph [**Publication Settings → Import/Export**](https://paragraph.com/settings/publication/import-export)**.**
2. Paste in your newsletter’s RSS feed and click **Connect**.
3. Every new post you publish on your existing platform will automatically:
   - Publish to your Paragraph publication
   - Send to your Paragraph subscribers via email and wallet
   - Unlock new ways for readers to support you by buying coins or remixing your post
   - Appear on discovery surfaces across Paragraph and beyond

You can edit, hide, or delete any crossposted post at any time, and it’s just as easy to turn off the connection.

Cross-posting works with any platform that supports RSS, including Substack, Beehiiv, Ghost, Medium, WordPress, and more.

Head to your [settings](https://paragraph.com/settings/publication/import-export) and connect your newsletter to take advantage of all the benefits of crossposting to Paragraph.
