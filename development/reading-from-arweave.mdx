Paragraph gives writers the option to store their posts on [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/), enabling permanent and censorship-resistant publishing. This means **anyone can permissionlessly access Paragraph posts via Arweave**, allowing for powerful integrations, self-hosted mirrors, or other dApps built on top of Paragraph data.

## Querying Arweave for Posts

To retrieve Paragraph posts from Arweave, follow these two steps:

### 1. Query Arweave via GraphQL for the transaction ID

You can search based on Arweave tags like the `Contributor` wallet or post metadata.

Example GraphQL query to fetch the **latest post** from a specific wallet:

```graphql
query GetParagraphPosts($wallet: String!) {
  transactions(
    tags: [
      { name: "AppName", values: ["Paragraph"] },
      { name: "Contributor", values: [$wallet] }
    ],
    sort: HEIGHT_DESC,
    first: 1
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **2. Fetch the post content using Arweave JS SDK**

Once you have the transaction ID, use the [Arweave JS SDK](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-js) to retrieve the post data.

Posts stored on Arweave include:

- Static HTML
- TipTap JSON (for rich content structure)
- Metadata (publish date, categories, tags, etc.)

## **Example Integration**

[This open-source repo](https://github.com/PirosB3/Paragraph-Farcaster-xposter) by [@PirosB3](https://github.com/PirosB3) demonstrates how to:

- Fetch Paragraph posts from Arweave
- Cross-post them to [Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/)

## **When to Use This Approach**

Use Arweave-based reading if:

- You want to build fully decentralized frontends or backup content
- You don’t want to rely on the Paragraph API or SDK
- You want to mirror Paragraph content across multiple protocols or UIs

For most app developers, our [API](/development/api-sdk-overview) and [SDK](/development/sdk/index) are easier to work with — but Arweave remains a valuable, trustless fallback.
