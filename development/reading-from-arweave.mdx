Paragraph gives writers the option to store their posts on [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/), enabling permanent and censorship-resistant publishing. This means **anyone can permissionlessly access Paragraph posts via Arweave**, allowing for powerful integrations, self-hosted mirrors, or other dApps built on top of Paragraph data.

## Querying Arweave for Posts

To retrieve Paragraph posts from Arweave, follow these two steps:

### 1. Query Arweave via GraphQL for the transaction ID

You can search based on Arweave tags like the `Contributor` wallet or post metadata.

Example GraphQL query to fetch the **latest post** from a specific wallet:

```graphql
query GetParagraphPosts($wallet: String!) {
  transactions(
    tags: [
      { name: "AppName", values: ["Paragraph"] },
      { name: "Contributor", values: [$wallet] }
    ],
    sort: HEIGHT_DESC,
    first: 1
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```
