# **Mirror to Paragraph Migration**

We’re migrating all [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) publications to Paragraph. This ensures your writing and subscribers are preserved while giving you access to Paragraph’s powerful tools for publishing, discovery, and monetization.

### Overview

- If you used the same wallet or email on both platforms, your Mirror publication will automatically appear inside your Paragraph account as a secondary publication.
- Nothing is deleted — you’ll have flexibility to merge, keep, or remove migrated content.
- Redirects are in place to protect your SEO and existing links.

<Note>
  **No action is needed by you.** When the migration is complete, you’ll see your Mirror publication inside your Paragraph dashboard.
</Note>

### Accessing Your Migrated Account

If you signed into Mirror with:

- **Wallet** → log into Paragraph with the same wallet.
- **Email** → log into Paragraph with the same email.

Your migrated Mirror publication will be tied to that Paragraph account automatically.

**If you don't have a Paragraph account**, all you need to do is login with the same email or wallet to access your migrated account.

**If you had separate email and wallet accounts on Mirror**, you may see multiple Paragraph accounts. See the **Duplicate Accounts** section below.

**If you use the same login info on Paragraph and Mirror**, you will see your migrated Mirror publication under your Paragraph account as an additional publication.

### What Moved From Mirror to Paragraph

Here’s what happens to your Mirror data during migration:

- **Published posts** → moved into a new Paragraph publication.
- **Drafts** → preserved and migrated as drafts.
- **Subscribers** → moved into that publication’s subscriber list.
- **Publication settings** → migrated where possible (name, description).

Everything will remain editable inside Paragraph once the migration is done.

### Redirects & SEO

To protect your traffic and search engine ranking:

- All Mirror post URLs will **permanently redirect (301)** to their new Paragraph equivalents.
- Your SEO should remain intact and crawlers will follow the redirects.
- Readers clicking on old Mirror links will land seamlessly on your migrated Paragraph posts.

### Duplicate Accounts

If you end up with more than one Paragraph account and would like to consolidate them, here's how to do that:

**How to consolidate:**

1. Decide which account you want to keep as your primary.
2. Login to the secondary account and head to [Publication Settings → Import/Export tab](https://paragraph.com/settings/publication/import-export).
3. Under **Export**, choose to export your subscribers and posts from the secondary publication.
4. Log out of your secondary account and login to your primary account.
5. Head to [Publication Settings → Import/Export tab](https://paragraph.com/settings/publication/import-export).
6. Import the two CSV files of subscribers and posts you just exported.
7. If you want, you can logout & log back into your secondary account, then delete the account from [Account Settings → Account](https://paragraph.com/settings/account/account).

### FAQ
