We’re migrating all [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) publications to Paragraph. This ensures your writing and subscribers are preserved while giving you access to Paragraph’s powerful tools for publishing, discovery, and monetization.

**Key points:**

- If you used the same wallet or email on both platforms, your Mirror publication will automatically appear inside your Paragraph account as a secondary publication.
- Nothing is deleted — you’ll have flexibility to merge, keep, or remove migrated content.
- Redirects are in place to protect your SEO and existing links.

<Note>
  **No action is needed by you.** When the migration is complete, you’ll see your Mirror publication inside your Paragraph dashboard.
