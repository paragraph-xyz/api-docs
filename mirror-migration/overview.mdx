# **Mirror to Paragraph Migration**

We’re migrating all [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) publications to Paragraph. This ensures your writing and subscribers are preserved while giving you access to Paragraph’s powerful tools for publishing, discovery, and monetization.

### Overview

- If you used the same wallet or email on both platforms, your Mirror publication will automatically appear inside your Paragraph account as a secondary publication.
- Nothing is deleted — you’ll have flexibility to merge, keep, or remove migrated content.
- Redirects are in place to protect your SEO and existing links.

<Note>
  **No action is needed by you.** When the migration is complete, you’ll see your Mirror publication inside your Paragraph dashboard.
</Note>

### Accessing Your Migrated Account

If you signed into Mirror with:

- **Wallet** → log into Paragraph with the same wallet.
- **Email** → log into Paragraph with the same email.

Your migrated Mirror publication will be tied to that Paragraph account automatically.

**If you don't have a Paragraph account**, all you need to do is login with the same email or wallet to access your migrated account.

**If you had separate email and wallet accounts on Mirror**, you may see multiple Paragraph accounts. See the **Duplicate Accounts** section below.

**If you use the same login info on Paragraph and Mirror**, you will see your migrated Mirror publication under your Paragraph account as an additional publication.

### What Moved From Mirror to Paragraph

Here’s what happens to your Mirror data during migration:

- **Published posts** → moved into a new Paragraph publication.
- **Drafts** → preserved and migrated as drafts.
- **Subscribers** → moved into that publication’s subscriber list.
- **Publication settings** → migrated where possible (name, description).

Everything will remain editable inside Paragraph once the migration is done.

### Redirects & SEO

To protect your traffic and search engine ranking:

- All Mirror post URLs will **permanently redirect (301)** to their new Paragraph equivalents.
- Your SEO should remain intact and crawlers will follow the redirects.
- Readers clicking on old Mirror links will land seamlessly on your migrated Paragraph posts.

### Duplicate Accounts

If you end up with more than one Paragraph account and would like to consolidate them, here's how to do that:

**How to consolidate:**

1. Decide which account you want to keep as your primary.
2. Login to the other account and head to Publication Settings -\>
3. Export subscribers & posts from the secondary publication (Dashboard → Import/Export).
4. Import them into your main publication.
5. Delete the redundant publication or account once you’re sure everything is consolidated.

This prevents duplicate posts or subscriber overlap and ensures all future publishing happens from one account.
