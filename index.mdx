## **Why Paragraph?**

- **Publish once, reach readers everywhere.** Your posts are delivered to your subscribers by email, shown instantly in the Farcaster mini app, and discoverable across various discovery platforms (including Paragraph’s personalized [Explore feed](https://paragraph.com/explore)).
- **New ways to earn.** Readers can support your writing with coins, a lightweight alternative to paywalls or ads that also let them share in your growth. Remixing gives readers a unique way to engage with your work and encourages them to share your writing more widely.
- **Built-in growth tools.** Get discovered through recommendations, engage your readers through automated email campaigns, and turn casual readers into subscribers through thoughtful subscribe prompts.
- **Frictionless onboarding.** Auto-crosspost to reach new readers and earn more without changing where you publish. Or bring everything over by importing your existing posts and subscribers directly into Paragraph.
- **Everything you expect from a newsletter platform.** Customize your publication with themes, enjoy best-in-class email deliverability and SEO, use your own domain, and take advantage of several other features to make Paragraph the best home for your writing online.
