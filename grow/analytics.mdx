### **How it works**

- **Google Analytics 4 (GA4):** Enter your Measurement ID (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX) to start sending traffic data.
- **Google Tag Manager (GTM):** Add your GTM ID if you prefer to manage tags and events through GTM.

### **Where to add your ID**

1. Go to your [**Publication Settings → Growth**](https://paragraph.com/settings/publication/growth)\*\* → Analytics\*\*.
2. Paste your GA4 Measurement ID or GTM ID into the provided field.
3. Changes save automatically — you don’t need to do anything else.

### **Why use Analytics?**

- Understand where your readers are coming from.
- Track which posts drive the most traffic.
- See how readers interact with your writing.
