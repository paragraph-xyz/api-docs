# **Embedded Subscribe Form**

Make it easy for readers to subscribe wherever they find you. Paragraph gives you a couple ways to encourage readers to subscribe to your publication:

- **Direct link** — send people straight to your signup page by appending /subscribe to your publication URL (e.g. https://paragraph.xyz/@blog/subscribe).
- **Embedded form** — copy the iframe embed code in your settings and paste it into your personal website or blog. The form will appear right on your page, so readers never have to leave to subscribe.
- **Style options** for your embed — choose from regular, minimal, or vertical layouts to match your site’s design.

Add the embed form to your personal website, portfolio, or company homepage so casual visitors can easily turn into long-term subscribers. You’ll find everything you need in the "Embed & Share" section on the [Growth tab](https://paragraph.com/settings/publication/growth) in publication settings.
