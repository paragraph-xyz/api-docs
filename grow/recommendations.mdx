# **Recommendations**

Recommendations are a powerful way to collaborate with other writers on Paragraph and grow together. It’s a trusted, word-of-mouth way to expand your audience while supporting writers you believe in.

## **How It Works**

Right after someone subscribes to your publication, they’ll be shown the list of publications you recommend with the option to subscribe.

## **Best Practices**

- **Recommend thoughtfully**: choose publications your readers will genuinely value, not just ones that drive growth.
- **Keep it relevant**: to increase conversion, recommend writing that's relevant to your audience.
- **Reciprocate**: build growth loops by coordinating with other writers to recommend each other.
