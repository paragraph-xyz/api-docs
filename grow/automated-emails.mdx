# **Automated Emails**

Automated emails let you engage with readers at the right moment, without needing to manually send messages every time. You can set up custom workflows triggered by reader actions, helping you onboard new subscribers and build deeper relationships with readers over time.

You can easily manage, customize, or add new automations in the **Automated emails** section of the [Growth tab](https://paragraph.com/settings/publication/growth) in your publication settings.

## **How it works**

- **Welcome email**: we provide a welcome email that is default-on and goes out as soon as someone subscribes.

- **Custom automations**: you can create additional emails triggered by specific reader actions (e.g., subscribing to your publication), and how long after that action the email is delivered.

- **Full control**: You can edit the subject line and body of each automated email, send yourself a test email, or delete it entirely.

## **Examples of what you can do**

- **Onboarding new readers**: send a welcome email immediately, then follow up 1, 3, and 7 days later to showcase your best posts and introduce yourself.
- **Community building**: nurture readers by following up after key actions, like supporting your work, leaving a comment, or sharing your writing.
- **Retention**: re-engage readers with thoughtful touchpoints so they continue to feel connected to your work.
