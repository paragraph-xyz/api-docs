Writer coins let readers back the writers they love. They build on post coins, letting readers back a writer across everything they publish, creating a lasting connection between writers and their readers.

Every publication on Paragraph can launch a writer coin.

When you launch your writer coin, you can reward the readers who’ve supported you in the past, including a select group that:

- Have collected your posts on Paragraph or Mirror
- Are currently subscribed to your newsletter
- Follow you on Farcaster
- Hold any of your post coins on Paragraph
- Hold your Zora creator coin (when you pair your writer coin with a Zora creator coin)

[More details on rewards here](/earn/writer-coin-rewards).

### **Launch your writer coin & make it a moment**

Launching your writer coin is a great opportunity to invite your readers to back your work. There's a good chance most activity will happen around when you launch your writer coin, so it's important to share your launch with friends, on social, other writers, and so on.

Some things you could consider as part of that announcement:

- Tell the story behind why you write and what you care about.
- Share how you plan to thank or recognize early backers.
- Highlight any benefits, perks, or special access you plan to offer your backers.
- Describe what their support will help you create.

- **Coin pairing** (optional). If you have a Zora creator coin, you can choose to pair it with your writer coin by adding the token contract address. You’ll see a confirmation once it’s paired.

### **How to earn with writer coins**

**The value of your writer coin increases**

When you launch your writer coin, you receive 50% of the total supply: you're allocated 500 million coins out of 1 billion total coins.

Your allocation vests each month over three years, meaning you receive 1/36th of your total allocation each month. Vesting begins immediately, with your first monthly tranche available at launch.

  style={{ width:"66%" }}
/>

As your readership and community grow, and demand for your coin increases, you’ll have the opportunity to sell your vested coins and realize a gain.

<Note>
  **Liquidity matters.** \
  To sell your writer coin, there must be demand for your writer coin and an active market of buyers. Without demand & buyers, you won’t be able to convert your coins into proceeds, which is why it's important to build awareness and interest in your writer coin.
</Note>

**You earn a share of every transaction**

You also earn 2% of every transaction involving your writer coin. For example, if someone buys or sells \$100 worth of your writer coin, you receive \$2. These funds are available immediately in your Paragraph wallet.

### **How do readers buy my writer coin?**

We've designed the experience so that buying your writer coin feels natural for readers. We surface the option in the right places, at the right moments, when readers are most likely to support your work.

Below are a few primary ways readers can find and purchase your writer coin.

**Writer coin page**

Every writer has a dedicated writer coin page (e.g., `https://paragraph.com/@username/coin` or `yourdomain.com/coin`). Writers can direct readers here as a focused place to buy their writer coin. The page also shows the top supporters and reward recipients, as well as other important details (e.g., contract address, exchange links).

Readers can also check if they have unclaimed rewards by entering their wallet address. If they’re eligible, they’ll be taken directly into the claim flow.

We’ll continue expanding this page, but it already gives writers a simple, direct home for everything related to their writer coin.

**Right after subscribing**

After someone subscribes to your publication, they’ll immediately see an option to support you further by purchasing your writer coin. This appears in the same modal flow as the subscription confirmation, making it an easy, natural next step for new readers who want to back your work.

**Publication homepage & post pages**

When you launch your writer coin, all existing support buttons automatically point to buying your coin. For any future posts and any coined posts that were already published, the **Support** buttons now point to the writer coin purchase flow.

If someone is already subscribed to your publication, the main button in the top navigation (normally “Subscribe”) becomes **Support**. This gives subscribers a clear, prominent way to back your work beyond the subscription.

**Explore page**

The Explore page includes a dedicated tab highlighting top writers based on the volume of support. Readers can browse this list, discover new writers, and purchase writer coins directly from those profiles.

These are the main ways readers and subscribers currently discover and buy writer coins. Over time, we’ll continue adding new discovery and purchase entry points to help readers find and support the writers they love.

We want writer coins to be an easy way for readers to back a writer across all their work, signal they were early, and participate in the writer's growth over time. We believe writer coins have the opportunity to be the primary way readers support writers and expand the economy for great writing & creative work, well beyond paid subscriptions and sponsorships.

We’re still early in building writer coins & we’d love your feedback to help us shape what comes next. If you have questions, ideas, or issues, drop us a note at [support@paragraph.com](mailto:support@paragraph.com).
