Writer coins let readers support and invest in the writers they love across all their writing.

Writer coins build on the foundation of post coins, which allowed readers to support individual posts. Writer coins extend that idea to your entire body of work, creating a lasting connection between you and your readers.

Every publication on Paragraph can launch a writer coin.

When you launch your writer coin, you can reward the readers who’ve supported you in the past, including a select group that:

- Have collected your posts on Paragraph or Mirror
- Are currently subscribed to your newsletter
- Hold your Zora creator coin (when you pair your writer coin with a Zora creator coin)

After you launch your writer coin, all your future post coins will be linked to your writer coin. When one of your posts grow in popularity, it benefits your writer coin as well.

### **Launch your writer coin & make it a moment.**

Launching your writer coin is a great opportunity to invite your subscribers, followers, and audience to back your work. There's a good chance most activity will happen around when you launch your writer coin, so it's important to share your launch with the world.

Some things you could consider as part of that announcement:

- Tell the origin story behind your writing, why you write, and remind folks what you write about.
- Let folks know any ideas you have for how to reward or show your appreciation for those that buy your writer coin.
- Invite your early readers to become early backers.

### **Writer coin set-up**

To launch your writer coin:

- Go to [**Publication Settings → Monetization**](https://paragraph.com/settings/publication/monetization).
- Make sure your payout wallet address is set correctly; this is where your earnings from your writer coin will go.
- Click the "Launch writer coin" button.

- **Coin pairing** (optional). If you have a Zora creator coin, you can choose to pair it with your writer coin by adding the token contract address. You’ll see a confirmation once it’s paired.

- Send **writer coin rewards** to your earliest supporters to show your appreciation and encourage sharing & discussion of your writer coin during the launch period. [More details here](/earn/writer-coin-rewards). 

### **Launching a writer coin**

**1. Launch your writer coin**

Set a name, symbol, and supply. This coin represents your overall creative output — not a single post.

**2. Readers collect your coin**

Your coin can be collected by anyone on Paragraph or Mirror. As readers collect, they show support and participate in your long-term success.

**3. You earn from every transaction**

You receive a percentage of every coin transaction. You also hold coins yourself, so as demand for your coin grows, your holdings appreciate.

**4. Reward your community**

Once your coin is live, you can distribute writer coin rewards to your subscribers, collectors, and Zora creator coin holders. (More on that below.)
