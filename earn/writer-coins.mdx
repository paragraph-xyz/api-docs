Writer coins let readers support and invest in the writers they love across all their writing.

Writer coins build on the foundation of post coins, which allowed readers to support individual posts. Writer coins extend that idea to your entire body of work, creating a lasting connection between you and your readers.

Every publication on Paragraph can launch a writer coin.

When you launch your writer coin, you can reward the readers who’ve supported you in the past, including a select group that:

- Have collected your posts on Paragraph or Mirror
- Are currently subscribed to your newsletter
- Hold your Zora creator coin (when you pair your writer coin with a Zora creator coin)

After you launch your writer coin, all your future post coins will be linked to your writer coin. When one of your posts grow in popularity, it benefits your writer coin as well.

### **Launch your writer coin & make it a moment.**

Launching your writer coin is a great opportunity to invite your subscribers, followers, and audience to back your work. There's a good chance most activity will happen around when you launch your writer coin, so it's important to share your launch with the world.

Some things you could consider as part of that announcement:

- Tell the story behind why you write and what you care about.
- Share how you plan to thank early backers, what kind of work their support will help enable, or any exclusive perks you plan to provide your backers.
- Invite early readers to become early supporters.

### **Writer coin set-up**

To launch your writer coin:

- Go to [**Publication Settings → Monetization**](https://paragraph.com/settings/publication/monetization).
- Make sure your payout wallet address is set correctly; this is where your earnings from your writer coin will go.
- Click the "Launch writer coin" button.

- **Coin pairing** (optional). If you have a Zora creator coin, you can choose to pair it with your writer coin by adding the token contract address. You’ll see a confirmation once it’s paired.

- Send **writer coin rewards** to your earliest supporters to show your appreciation and encourage sharing & discussion of your writer coin during the launch period. [More details here](/earn/writer-coin-rewards).
- After you make it through the launch flow, your writer coin will be live.

### **How to earn with writer coins**

**The value of your writer coin increases**

When you launch your writer coin, you receive 50% of the total supply: you're allocated 500 million coins out of 1 billion total coins.

Your allocation vests each month over three years, meaning you receive 1/36th of your total allocation each month. Vesting begins immediately, with your first monthly tranche available at launch.

As your readership and community grow, and demand for your coin increases, you’ll have the opportunity to sell your vested coins and realize a gain.

<Note>
  **Liquidity matters.** \
  To sell your writer coin, there must be demand for your writer coin and an active market of buyers. Without demand & buyers, you won’t be able to convert your coins into proceeds, which is why it's important to build awareness and interest in your writer coin.
</Note>

**You earn a share of every transaction**

You also earn 2% of every transaction involving your writer coin. For example, if someone buys or sells \$100 worth of your writer coin, you receive \$2. Those funds are immediately available to withdraw from your Paragraph wallet.

**Your post coins are linked to your writer coin**

Finally, after you launch your writer coin, all your future post coins become linked to it.

Each post coin shares a liquidity pool with your writer coin. When one of your posts gains momentum or trading volume, that appreciation flows back & benefits the value of your writer coin.

### **How do readers buy my writer coin?**

Prompting readers to buy your writer coin is simple and naturally woven into your publication. We surface the option in the right places, at the right moments, when readers are most likely to support your work.

Below are a few primary ways readers can find and purchase your writer coin.

**Right after subscribing**

After someone subscribes to your publication, they’ll immediately see an option to support you further by purchasing your writer coin. This appears in the same modal flow as the subscription confirmation, making it an easy, natural next step for new readers who want to back your work.

**Publication homepage & post pages**

Once someone is subscribed, the main call-to-action button in the top navigation bar (which normally says **Subscribe**) changes to **Back writer**. This button appears on the publication homepage and the post page, and tends to generate the most clicks out of all the buttons.

On your publication homepage, readers will also see a primary **Back writer** button on the right siderail, beneath your publication info.

Clicking any **Back writer** button launches the writer coin purchase flow, allowing subscribers to buy your coin directly without leaving your publication.

**Explore page**

The Explore page includes a dedicated tab highlighting top writers based on the volume of support. Readers can browse this list, discover new writers, and purchase writer coins directly from those profiles.

These are the main ways readers and subscribers currently discover and buy writer coins. Over time, we’ll continue adding new discovery and purchase entry points to help readers find and support the writers they love.
