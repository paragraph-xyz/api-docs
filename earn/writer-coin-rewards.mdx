When you launch your writer coin, you can immediately reward the readers who’ve supported you most. Writer coin rewards are a great way to show your appreciation to those that have supported you in the past, but also to spark early interest and discussion around your writer coin.

Over time, if rewards prove meaningful, we would love to give writers more flexibility and control, including custom allocations, adjustable percentages by group, and the ability to reward specific behaviors. But today, the goal is simple: make it easy to recognize your community from day one.

## **Reward pool**

Each writer coin includes a default **5% rewards pool**. You can choose which groups to reward, skip any you don’t want, and send everything with one click. Rewards are available for recipients to claim immediately after you launch.

Below is a breakdown of how the total 1B coin supply is allocated at launch:

| Category                 | % of supply | # of coins        |
| :----------------------- | :---------- | :---------------- |
| **Writer / publication** | **50%**     | **500,000,000**   |
| **Rewards pool**         | **5%**      | **50,000,000**    |
| **Market**               | **45%**     | **450,000,000**   |
| **Total coin supply**    | **100%**    | **1,000,000,000** |

## **Reward categories**

You can choose to reward any of the following groups below (all are optional):

- **Paragraph collectors: **Reward readers who’ve collected your Paragraph posts. Allocation is weighted by how much they've collected, so your biggest collectors receive the most.
- **Mirror collectors: **Reward readers who’ve collected your posts on Mirror. Allocation scales with the number of Mirror collectibles they hold.
- **Paragraph post coin holders: **Reward readers who’ve supported your posts through post coins. Allocation scales with the number of coins each supporter holds.
- **Token holders** (with coin pairing): if you pair your Zora creator coin, you can reward current holders of that token. Allocation is weighted by token balance.
- **Your subscribers: **Reward everyone on your email list with a connected wallet. We have a small skew toward rewarding your longest-tenured subscribers.
- **Farcaster followers:** Reward your Farcaster followers. Each follower receives an equal share.

| Reward category                                            | % of supply | # of coins     |
| :--------------------------------------------------------- | :---------- | :------------- |
| Paragraph collectors (past collectors on Paragraph)        | **1.33%**   | **13,333,333** |
| Paragraph supporters (post-coin holders / past supporters) | **1.33%**   | **13,333,333** |
| Mirror collectors (past collectors on Mirror)              | **1.33%**   | **13,333,333** |
| Token holders (Zora or other ERC-20, with pairing)         | **0.5%**    | **5,000,000**  |
| Current subscribers                                        | **0.3%**    | **3,000,000**  |
| Farcaster followers                                        | **0.2%**    | **2,000,000**  |
| **Total rewards pool**                                     | **5.0%**    | **50,000,000** |

## **Why rewards matter**

Your earliest supporters are often the people who shape your publication’s foundation. Writer coin rewards give you a simple way to recognize them — and invite them into the next chapter of your work.

Well-timed rewards also create a burst of activity around your launch, helping more readers discover, share, and get involved with your writer coin.

If you have questions or need help with rewards, we’re here to help: [**support@paragraph.com**](mailto:support@paragraph.com).

For now, each writer coin includes a default rewards pool of 5% of the total supply (out of 1 billion coins, so 50 million coins). You can choose to skip or reward any of the below. Rewards are available to be claimed by recipients as soon as you send them.

| **Group**                 | **Share of**<br />**total supply** | **Approx. coin**<br />**allocation (out of 1B)** |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| Past collectors           | ~3.3%                              | ~33,000,000 coins                                |
| Zora creator coin holders | ~1.6%                              | ~16,000,000 coins                                |
| Current subscribers       | ~0.1%                              | ~1,000,000 coins                                 |
| **Total rewards**         | **~5%**                            | **~50,000,000 coins**                            |

### **Reward past collectors (Paragraph + Mirror)**

Rewards are distributed to up to 50 of your top collectors: the readers who’ve collected your posts the most across Paragraph and Mirror. Allocation is weighted by how much each reader has collected, so your biggest supporters receive the largest writer coin rewards.

### **Reward Zora creator coin holders (with coin pairing)**

Once you’ve paired your Zora creator coin with your writer coin, rewards are distributed to up to 50 of your top Zora holders. Allocation is based on the number of Zora coins each holder owns — the more they hold, the greater their share.

### **Celebrate your earliest supporters**

The readers who believed in you first are often the ones who matter most. Writer coin rewards give you a simple way to recognize their support and invite them to participate in the launch of your writer coin.

These rewards also help spark discussion and sharing of your writer coin during the launch period, which is critical for generating awareness and demand.
