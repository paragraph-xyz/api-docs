When you launch your writer coin, you can immediately reward the readers who’ve supported you most. Writer coin rewards are a great way to show your appreciation to those that have supported you in the past, but also to spark early interest and discussion around your writer coin.

At launch, we’re starting with a simple default that helps writers easily reward their supporters without having to configure everything themselves. Over time, we plan to give writers more control, including the ability to set their own allocation percentage, how to split rewards across different groups, and what behavior they want to reward.

For now, each writer coin includes a default rewards pool of 5% of the total supply (out of 1 billion coins, so 50 million coins). You can choose to skip or reward any of the below. Rewards are available to be claimed by recipients as soon as you send them.

| **Group**                 | **Share of**<br />**total supply** | **Approx. coin**<br />**allocation (out of 1B)** |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| Past collectors           | ~3.3%                              | ~33,000,000 coins                                |
| Zora creator coin holders | ~1.6%                              | ~16,000,000 coins                                |
| Current subscribers       | ~0.1%                              | ~1,000,000 coins                                 |
| **Total rewards**         | **~5%**                            | **~50,000,000 coins**                            |

### **Reward past collectors (Paragraph + Mirror)**

Rewards are distributed to up to 50 of your top collectors: the readers who’ve collected your posts the most across Paragraph and Mirror. Allocation is weighted by how much each reader has collected, so your biggest supporters receive the largest writer coin rewards.

### **Reward current subscribers**

Rewards go to up to 50 of your longest-subscribed readers, determined by signup date. Each subscriber receives an equal share of the subscriber allocation.

### **Reward Zora creator coin holders (with coin pairing)**

Once you’ve paired your Zora creator coin with your writer coin, rewards are distributed to up to 50 of your top Zora holders. Allocation is based on the number of Zora coins each holder owns — the more they hold, the greater their share.

### **Celebrate your earliest supporters**

The readers who believed in you first are often the ones who matter most. Writer coin rewards give you a simple way to recognize their support and invite them to participate in the launch of your writer coin.

These rewards also help spark discussion and sharing of your writer coin during the launch period, which is critical for generating awareness and demand.
