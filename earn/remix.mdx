# **Remixing**

Remixing turns writing into a conversation. Instead of stopping at likes or reposts, readers can respond to a post by publishing their own take — expanding on the idea, challenging it, or taking it in a new direction.

### **How it works**

- On any post with coins enabled, click the **Remix** button at the top.
- Choose **Start remixing** and you’ll be taken straight into the Editor.
- Write your response, publish, and your remix is automatically linked to the original post.

### **Why remix?**

- **More reach for both writers** — When a post is remixed, both coins are connected. As either post gains traction, both benefit.
- **Fresh entry point for readers** — Remixes let new audiences discover your work through existing conversations.
- **Creative spark** — Remixing makes it easier to overcome the blank page and build on ideas that inspire you.

### **Where remixes appear**

- Remixed posts display in the footer of the original post.
- Each remix has its own coin, automatically paired with the parent post’s coin.
- Readers can support either post, and both writers share in the momentum.

### **Pro tip**

Use remixing to collaborate with writers you admire. A thoughtful remix can bring your voice into an existing conversation and grow your audience faster than starting from scratch.
