# **Remixing**

Remixing turns writing into a conversation. Instead of stopping at likes or reposts, readers can respond to a post by publishing their own take, expanding on the idea, challenging it, or taking it in a new direction.

### **How to remix a post**

- On any post with coins enabled, click the **Remix** button at the top.
- Choose **Start remixing** and you’ll be taken straight into the Editor.
- Write your response, publish, and your remix is automatically linked to the original post.

### **Why remix?**

- **More reach for both writers** —  remixed posts are linked to the original post coin, so when either post grows in popularity, both benefit.
- **Reach more readers** — remixing ties your writing into ongoing conversations and helps new audiences discover you.
- **Creative spark** — remixing makes it way easier to overcome the blank page and come up with ideas to write about.

### **Where remixes appear**

Remixed posts display in the footer of the original post and are supported by popularity, making it easy to find the best responses to the original post.

Remixing is a great way to collaborate with writers you admire. A thoughtful remix can bring your voice into an existing conversation and grow your audience faster than starting from scratch.
