Post coins give readers a simple, compelling way to support your work in a new way, while allowing them to participate in the growth of your writing and encouarging them to share it widely.

When a reader supports a post with coins, they:

- Boost its visibility across Paragraph, where the most-supported posts rise to the top.
- Signal that your writing resonates with them.
- Are more likely to share your writing with their friends & followers, helping introduce your writing to new readers.
- Directly support you as a writer, giving you a new way to earn.

All while keeping the experience lightweight and focused on writing. No confusing crypto lingo or overly-financialized UX. We use simple terms like **support** and provide three easy tiers so readers don’t have to think about prices, quantities, or other confusing coin details.

### **How it works for writers**

1. **Enable post coins**
   - Go to [**Publication Settings → Monetization**](https://paragraph.com/settings/publication/monetization).
   - Toggle on **Post coins** (you can also enable & disable coins on individual posts later when publishing a new post).
   - Make sure your payout wallet address is set correctly — this is where your earnings from coins will go.

2. **Make sure coins are enabled when publishing**
   - In the publishing flow for a new post, make sure to leave the _Coin this post_ toggle on.
   - You have the option to pick a ticker symbol (up to 8 characters).

3. **Readers support your post**
   - On the post page, readers can support you in-frame by choosing from preset tiers (e.g., _Liked it_, _Loved it_, _True Believer_).
   - Each action creates coins for your post and sends direct support to you.

### **Why coins?**

Today’s monetization options come with hard trade-offs: subscriptions require full-time writing and can feel impersonal; ads require a lot of effort & erode the reader experience; and tips & one-off payments rarely scale. We believe there’s room for something new.

Coins are part of our ongoing attempt to expand the idea economy. We hope coins will allow readers to:

- Turn up the volume on an idea that resonates with them.
- Signal something about themselves through the writing they back.
- Find others who share their interests or values.
- Support writing they enjoy and encourage more of it to exist in the world.

All while giving writers new ways to earn and feel like their work matters.

### Technical details

Coins are deployed using the [Doppler protocol](https://doppler.so) on the [Base](https://base.org) network. Each post coin is a standard ERC‑20 token with a fixed total supply and fair-launch mechanics.

**What happens when a coin launches?**

- **Total supply**: 1 billion (1,000,000,000) tokens per post coin
- **Writer/creator allocation**: 10% of the total supply, vested linearly over 1 year
- **Transaction fees**: 1% of each buy or sell is split as follows:
  - 0.475% to the writer/creator
  - 0.475% to Paragraph
  - 0.05% to the Doppler protocol

These fees accumulate in the post coin contract and can be claimed either through the Paragraph UI or directly onchain.

**How do writers/creators earn money with coins?**

Writers/creators can earn from coins in two ways:

1. **A percentage of every transaction**
   - Writers/creators receive a portion of the trading fees from anyone buying or selling their coin.
   - These are available to claim as soon as they accumulate.
2. **Appreciation in the value of their their post coins**
   - Writers/creators receive 10% of the total supply of their own coin.
   - If their post gains attention and people continue supporting it (i.e., buying their post coin), the value of their coin can go up. Writers/creators have the opportunity to sell any of their post coins that have vested if there’s enough demand.

**Tell me more about liquidity & how it impacts my ability to sell my coins.**

It’s important to know that having coins doesn’t always mean you can sell them immediately.

Each post coin has its own market, and the amount of trading activity (liquidity) varies depending on how much interest or support that post receives. If few people are buying or selling a given coin, it may be hard to sell any coins at all. Even if there's a market, selling large amounts may have a notable impact on the price.

**How about more details on how coins are deployed?**

- Coins are deployed using Doppler’s `AirlockFactory` contract on Base.
- Pricing is powered by a **static bonding curve** on top of a Uniswap v3 pool, enabling fair pricing and mitigating bot-based sniping.
- You can find the latest smart contract implementation and details on [doppler.so](https://doppler.so).
