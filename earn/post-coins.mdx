### **Post Coins**

Post coins give readers a simple, compelling way to support your work in a new way, while allowing them to participate in the growth of your writing and encouarging them to share it widely.

When a reader supports a post with coins, they:

- Boost its visibility across Paragraph, where the most-supported posts rise to the top.
- Signal that your writing resonates with them.
- Are more likely to share your writing with their friends & followers, helping introduce your writing to new readers.
- Directly support you as a writer, giving you a new way to earn.

All while keeping the experience lightweight and focused on writing. No confusing crypto lingo or overly-financialized UX. We use simple terms like **support** and provide three easy tiers so readers donâ€™t have to think about prices, quantities, or other confusing coin details.

### **How it works for writers**

1. **Enable post coins**
   - Go to [**Publication Settings â†’ Monetization**](https://paragraph.com/settings/publication/monetization).
   - Toggle on **Post coins** (you can also enable & disable coins on individual posts later when publishing a new post).
   - Make sure your payout wallet address is set correctly â€” this is where your earnings from coins will go.

2. **Make sure coins are enabled when publishing**
   - In the publishing flow for a new post, make sure to leave the _Coin this post_ toggle on.
   - You have the option to pick a ticker symbol (up to 8 characters).

3. **Readers support your post**
   - On the post page, readers can support you in-frame by choosing from preset tiers (e.g., _Liked it_, _Loved it_, _True Believer_).
   - Each action creates coins for your post and sends direct support to you.

### **Why coins?**

Traditional monetization has trade-offs: subscriptions require constant publishing, ads erode the reading experience, and one-off tips rarely scale. Coins give writers a new option â€” readers can support a single post they love, amplifying its reach and rewarding the writer behind it .

By design, coins:

- Encourage patronage and expression, not speculation.
- Make it easy for readers to show support in just a click.
- Fuel discovery, sending the best ideas into wider circulation.

Do you want me to go ahead and draft **Remixing** next?
