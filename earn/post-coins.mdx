Post coins give readers a simple, compelling way to support your work in a new way, while allowing them to participate in the growth of your writing and encouarging them to share it widely.

When a reader supports a post with coins, they:

- Boost its visibility across Paragraph, where the most-supported posts rise to the top.
- Signal that your writing resonates with them.
- Are more likely to share your writing with their friends & followers, helping introduce your writing to new readers.
- Directly support you as a writer, giving you a new way to earn.

All while keeping the experience lightweight and focused on writing. No confusing crypto lingo or overly-financialized UX. We use simple terms like **support** and provide three easy tiers so readers don’t have to think about prices, quantities, or other confusing coin details.

### **How it works for writers**

1. **Enable post coins**
   - Go to [**Publication Settings → Monetization**](https://paragraph.com/settings/publication/monetization).
   - Toggle on **Post coins** (you can also enable & disable coins on individual posts later when publishing a new post).
   - Make sure your payout wallet address is set correctly — this is where your earnings from coins will go.

2. **Make sure coins are enabled when publishing**
   - In the publishing flow for a new post, make sure to leave the _Coin this post_ toggle on.
   - You have the option to pick a ticker symbol (up to 8 characters).

3. **Readers support your post**
   - On the post page, readers can support you in-frame by choosing from preset tiers (e.g., _Liked it_, _Loved it_, _True Believer_).
   - Each action creates coins for your post and sends direct support to you.

### **Why coins?**

Today’s monetization options come with hard trade-offs: subscriptions require full-time writing and can feel impersonal; ads require a lot of effort & erode the reader experience; and tips & one-off payments rarely scale. We believe there’s room for something new.

Coins are part of our ongoing attempt to expand the idea economy. We hope coins will allow readers to:

- Turn up the volume on an idea that resonates with them.
- Signal something about themselves through the writing they back.
- Find others who share their interests or values.
- Support writing they enjoy and encourage more of it to exist in the world.

All while giving writers new ways to earn and feel like their work matters.
