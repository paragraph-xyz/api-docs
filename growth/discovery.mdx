# **Discovery**

Growing your audience is built into Paragraph from the start. Every post you publish isn’t just sent to your subscribers, it’s surfaced across Paragraph and beyond.

### **How readers discover your work**

- **Explore feeds** — posts appear in the [_For You_ feed](https://paragraph.com/home) (personalized for each reader) and the [_Explore_ feed](https://paragraph.com/explore) (trending and recent posts across all of Paragraph).
- **Recommendations** — writers can recommend your publication to their readers.
- **Publication homepages** — every publication has its own site optimized for SEO and sharing, so new readers can find you through search, LLM's, and links.
- **Paragraph Mini app on Farcaster **— your posts appear directly in the Farcaster feed, where your followers can read, subscribe, and support you without leaving the app. New posts also trigger Farcaster notifications to your subscribers.
- **Other powerful integrations** — your posts are surfaced in discovery apps that integrate with Paragraph, like [Interface](https://www.interface.social/), [Daylight](https://www.daylight.xyz/), and others, helping new readers find your work across the onchain ecosystem.
