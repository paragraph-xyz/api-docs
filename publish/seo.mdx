# **SEO**

Paragraph is built to maximize your publication’s visibility in search engines and LLM/AI models, so your writing can be discovered by the widest possible audience.

### **How Paragraph optimizes SEO**

- **Static rendering** — all pages are rendered statically for ultra-fast loading and strong crawlability.
- **Optimized images** — uploaded images are automatically resized, compressed, and blurred before loading to reduce layout shift.
- **Shared domain authority** — instead of subdomains, your publication lives on the root [paragraph.xyz](http://paragraph.xyz) domain, giving your posts the benefit of Paragraph’s overall SEO strength.
- **Clean metadata** — we auto-generate meta tags, open graph data, and descriptive post slugs. You can override these in post settings for more control.
- **Sitemap integration** — every publication and post is included in sitemaps, making it easy for crawlers to index your work.
- **Core Web Vitals** — Paragraph is tuned for CLS, LCP, and other performance metrics that boost rankings.

### **Recent enhancements**

- Expanded sitemaps, including dedicated **Google News sitemaps** for faster news indexing.
- Optimized robots.txt to remove low-value or restricted pages from crawlers.
- Added llms.txt files for Paragraph and each publication, guiding LLMs in how to best crawl your posts.
