[Creating a publication](https://paragraph.com/setup) takes just a couple of quick steps detailed below.

### **Step 1: Choose a name and URL**

On the setup screen, you’ll be asked for:

- **Publication name** – the name readers will see on your publication homepage, on your posts, and when you share your publication.
- **Publication URL** – your unique Paragraph link (you'll have the opportunity to connect a [custom domain](/publish/custom-domains) in your publication settings).

You can update your publication name and URL at any time in your settings.

### **Step 2: Confirmation & onboarding**

Once you create your publication, you’ll see a confirmation screen with quick links to help you get started:

- **Write your first post** – Jump straight into the editor.
- **Customize** – Adjust your publication’s theme and email delivery settings.
- **Import** – Bring over your posts and subscribers from another platform.
- **Learn** – Browse more docs to get comfortable with Paragraph.
