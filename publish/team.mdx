Paragraph makes it simple to build a team around your publication.

In the **Team** section of your [publication settings](https://paragraph.com/settings/publication/blog), you can add team members by entering their email address, wallet address, or both. Once added, they’ll be able to log into Paragraph and contribute to your publication.

### **Adding team members**

1. Go to [**Publication settings**](https://paragraph.com/settings/publication/blog)\*\* → Team\*\*.
2. Click **Add team member**.
3. Enter the member’s email and/or wallet address.
4. Assign a role (Admin, Writer, Editor, or Guest Writer).
5. Click **Add member**.

When the person logs in (or signs up for a new account), they’ll automatically gain access to your publication with the permissions you set.

### **Roles and permissions**

Here are the default roles to choose from for each team member:

- **Owner** – full control over the publication.
- **Admin** – same as Owner, except cannot remove the Owner.
- **Writer** – can create, edit, and delete their own posts.
- **Editor** – can edit and publish posts by others, but cannot manage settings or team members.
- **Guest Writer** – can create and edit their own posts, but cannot publish.
- **No role** – removes permissions for that team member.
