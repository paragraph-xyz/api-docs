# Export

Paragraph makes it easy to export your data or clean up your publication when needed.

---

## Export your data

From the [Import/Export page](https://paragraph.com/settings/publication/import-export) in your publication settings, you can export:

- **Posts** — download all of your posts as a CSV file, including titles, content, publication dates, and metadata.
- **Subscribers** — export your full subscriber list as a CSV, including email addresses, subscription dates, and related details.

Exports are especially useful if you want to back up your work, analyze subscribers, or consolidate multiple Paragraph accounts.

## Delete all posts

If you need to reset your publication, you can choose to permanently delete all posts.\
This action will remove every post in your publication (including those imported or created manually).

<Warning>
  Warning: This cannot be undone.
</Warning>

Writers most often use this option when merging multiple publications or accounts and they want to avoid redundant posts to consolidate traffic.

## Deleting your account

If you want to delete your entire account (including posts, subscribers, and publications), you can do this from your [**Account settings**](https://paragraph.com/account/account) page. Be sure to export your posts and subscribers first if you’d like to keep a copy.
