## Why have multiple publications?

Most writers only need a single publication, especially if their writing has a consistent theme or tone. But if you’re publishing in very different areas (for example, startup advice vs. a travel blog), it can make sense to keep them separate.

A simple rule of thumb: \*\*put yourself in the reader’s shoes. \*\*If your next post would feel unexpected or irrelevant to someone subscribed to your current publication, it may be better suited to a separate one.

## Creating and switching publications

1. Head to your **dashboard**.
2. Use the dropdown in the top-left navigation bar to create a new publication or switch between existing ones.
3. Each publication has its own settings, subscribers, and branding.

## Already have multiple accounts?

If you’ve previously created separate Paragraph accounts to manage different publications, you can now consolidate them:

1. From the old account, go to [**Import/Export**](https://paragraph.com/settings/publication/import-export) in your publication settings and export posts and subscribers.
2. Sign into the account where you want everything to live.
3. Switch into the desired publication, then import the export file.
4. Once everything looks good, you can delete the old account if you like.
