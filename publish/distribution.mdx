# Distribution

When you publish on Paragraph, your posts can be delivered directly to your subscribers via email and wallets.

### Email delivery

- Every post can be sent as an email to your subscribers’ inboxes.
- Emails are sent from [your-publication-slug@newsletter.paragraph.xyz](mailto:your-publication-slug@newsletter.paragraph.xyz).
- Replies go to the email address connected to your account.
- If you’re publishing to a [section](/publish/sections), only subscribers of that section will receive the email.

### Wallet delivery

- Posts can also be delivered to subscribers’ wallets.
- We use XMTP to send new post notifications to wallets.
- Additionally, with the Paragraph mini app on Farcaster, subscribers receive notifications inside Farcaster whenever there's a new post. This means readers can discover your work directly where they spend time.

### Email deliverability best practices

Getting new posts into the inbox is not always straightforward. Some simple ways to help improve deliverability:

- Encourage subscribers to move your welcome email to their Primary tab (or mark you as VIP).
- Publish consistently at similar times to build reader engagement.
- Clean your list periodically by removing dormant or bounced emails.

On our end, we actively work to protect email reputation by:

- Monitoring spam filters (especially crypto-related trigger words).
- Managing IPs and sender domains so higher-quality lists are protected.
- Throttling subscriber imports to prevent spam or abuse.
