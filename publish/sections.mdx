# Organize your publication with Sections

Sections let you organize your writing by topic, series, or contributor. 

Readers can choose which sections they want to subscribe to, giving them more control while helping you keep things organized. By default, readers are subscribed to all sections, but they can opt out of the ones they’re not interested in.

### Creating a section

1. Go to [Publication settings](https://paragraph.com/settings/publication/blog) and scroll to Sections.
2. Click "Add section".
3. Enter a name (e.g., “Weekly Digest” or “Deep Dives”) and an optional description so readers know what to expect.
4. Choose whether to automatically add your existing subscribers to this section.
5. Click Save.

### Why use sections?

- Organize your posts by theme, project, or contributor, making it easier for new readers to find what they're interested in.
- Give readers choice over what they receive in their inbox.
- Unify your work under one publication. Instead of splitting into separate newsletters, you can create sections (e.g., “Podcast” vs. “Updates”) and let readers decide which ones they want to subscribe to. This keeps your audience together while still respecting their preferences
