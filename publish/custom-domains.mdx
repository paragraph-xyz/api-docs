---

Set up a custom domain to strengthen your brand and retain the SEO value you build over time. Instead of `paragraph.com/@username`, your publication can live at `example.com` or `blog.example.com`.

Activating a custom domain is a one-time \$50 purchase from your [publication settings](https://paragraph.com/settings/publication/blog).

---

## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you:

- Own a domain through a registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.)
- Unlock the feature in Publication Settings (one-time \$50 fee)
- Have access to your DNS dashboard

---

## DNS configuration

All custom domains use a **CNAME record** pointing to `cname.paragraph.com`. You'll also need to add the **TXT records** shown in your Publication Settings for verification.

### Subdomains (blog.example.com) — Recommended

Subdomains work with all DNS providers and are the easiest to set up.

| Type  | Name                                  | Value               |
| ----- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| CNAME | blog                                  | cname.paragraph.com |
| TXT   | Provided in your Publication Settings | Provided value      |
| TXT   | Provided in your Publication Settings | Provided value      |

### Root domains (example.com)

Root (apex) domains require your DNS provider to support CNAME or ALIAS records at the apex. Not all providers support this.

| Type           | Name                                  | Value               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| CNAME or ALIAS | @                                     | cname.paragraph.com |
| TXT            | Provided in your Publication Settings | Provided value      |
| TXT            | Provided in your Publication Settings | Provided value      |

If your registrar doesn't allow adding a CNAME record for `@`, try adding an **ALIAS** record instead. If neither option is available, consider [moving your DNS to Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/) (free)\
which supports CNAME at the apex. You can keep your domain registered at your current registrar.

## Common setup mistakes

### Using the full domain in the Name field

Most DNS providers automatically append your domain to whatever you enter in the Name field.

| You enter          | What gets created                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `@`                | `example.com` ✓                  |
| `blog`             | `blog.example.com` ✓             |
| `example.com`      | `example.com.example.com` ✗      |
| `blog.example.com` | `blog.example.com.example.com` ✗ |

### Conflicting A records

If you have an existing **A record** for the same domain, delete it before adding the CNAME. A records take precedence and will prevent your domain from routing to Paragraph.

### Wildcard records

If you have a **wildcard record** (`*`) pointing to another server, it may interfere with your subdomain. Either:

- Delete the wildcard record, or
- Make sure your specific subdomain record is set up correctly (specific records should override wildcards, but some providers\
  behave differently)

## Verification

1. Add your domain in **Publication Settings**.
2. Copy the **TXT records** shown and add them at your registrar.
3. Add the **CNAME** record pointing to `cname.paragraph.com`.
4. Wait at least 30 minutes, then click the refresh (↻) button in Paragraph.
5. Once verified, your publication will load at your new domain.

DNS propagation can take up to **24–48 hours**, though most changes appear within a few hours.

## Troubleshooting

### "Custom hostname does not CNAME to this zone"

This means your domain isn't pointing to `cname.paragraph.com`. Check that:

- You added a CNAME record, not an A record
- There's no conflicting A record for the same domain
- There's no wildcard (`*`) record overriding your settings
- Your DNS changes have been saved/published

### Domain shows as verified but returns a 404 error

Your verification TXT records are correct, but traffic isn't reaching Paragraph. This usually means:

- The CNAME record is missing or points to the wrong target
- An old A record is still active (possibly pointing to `76.76.21.21` from a previous setup)

### Root domain won't work

Your DNS provider likely doesn't support CNAME or ALIAS at the apex. Options:

1. **Move DNS to Cloudflare** (free, keeps domain registered elsewhere)
2. **Use a subdomain** like `www.example.com` instead

## What happens to your old URL?

We set up a **permanent redirect** from your old `paragraph.com` URL to your new custom domain. Search engines will follow the redirect, so your SEO won’t be harmed.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

- **Unverified domain** → make sure TXT record matches exactly, wait for propagation, click refresh.
- **404 error** → verification not complete. Double-check your DNS records, then refresh.
- **Cloudflare users** → turn off the orange cloud (DNS-only mode).

### Timeline expectations

| Time        | What to expect                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 0–30 min    | Changes propagating, may not work yet |
| 30 min–2 hr | Most domains begin resolving          |
| 2–24 hr     | Should be working for nearly everyone |
| 24–48 hr    | Contact support if still not working  |
