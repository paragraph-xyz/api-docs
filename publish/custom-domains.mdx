# Custom domains

Give your publication polished branding and better SEO by setting up a custom domain. Instead of `paragraph.xyz/@username`, your publication can live at `example.com` or `blog.example.com`.

Activating a custom domain is a one-time \$50 purchase from your [publication settings](https://paragraph.com/settings/publication/blog).

---

## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you:

- Own a domain through a registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.).
- Unlock the feature in Publication Settings (one-time \$50 fee).
- Have access to your DNS dashboard.

## DNS configuration

### Root domains (example.com)

| Type | Name                                  | Value          |
| ---- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| A    | @                                     | 76.76.21.21    |
| TXT  | Provided in your Publication Settings | Provided value |

### Subdomains (blog.example.com)

| Type  | Name                                  | Value          |
| ----- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| CNAME | blog                                  | paragraph.xyz  |
| TXT   | Provided in your Publication Settings | Provided value |

---

## Verification

1. Add your domain in **Publication Settings**.
2. Copy the **TXT record** shown and add it at your registrar.
3. Add the required **A** (or **CNAME**) record.
4. Wait at least 30 minutes, then click the refresh (↻) button in Paragraph.
5. Once verified, your publication will load at your new domain.

DNS propagation can take up to **24–48 hours**, though most work within a few hours.

## What happens to your old URL?

We set up a **permanent redirect** from your old `paragraph.xyz` URL to your new custom domain. Search engines will follow the redirect, so your SEO won’t be harmed.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

- **Unverified domain** → make sure TXT record matches exactly, wait for propagation, click refresh.
- **404 error** → verification not complete. Double-check your DNS records, then refresh.
- **Cloudflare users** → turn off the orange cloud (DNS-only mode).

### Timeline expectations

| Time        | What to expect                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 0–30 min    | Changes propagating, may not work yet |
| 30 min–2 hr | Most domains begin resolving          |
| 2–24 hr     | Should be working for nearly everyone |
| 24–48 hr    | Contact support if still not working  |
