# **Customize your theme**

Your publication’s theme controls how your publication and posts look and feel to readers. You can adjust the design any time from \*\*Publication settings → \*\*[**Edit theme**](https://paragraph.com/settings/theme).

### **What you can customize**

- **Colors** — choose the primary accent color for your publication.
- **Fonts** — pick fonts for headers and body text to match your style.
- **Layout** — switch between list or grid layouts for your homepage.
- **Featured post** — highlight a post at the top of your publication.
- **Most popular posts** — display your most read posts to new readers.
- **Stats visibility** — show subscribers, supporters, and other stats as a form of social proof for new readers.

### **Why it matters**

A well-designed theme helps readers recognize your work, welcomes new readers to your work, and makes your publication feel like home.
