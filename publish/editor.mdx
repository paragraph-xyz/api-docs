The Paragraph editor is designed for writers: fast, distraction-free, and built for long-form publishing. You can draft, format, and enhance your posts with embeds and interactive blocks, then preview and publish with ease.

To open the editor, click “New post” from your dashboard.

This guide will help you go from a blank page to a published post, including tips on drafting, editing, and formatting along the way.

## Start your draft

- Cover image — drag an image onto the cover area, click to upload, or generate a cover image using our built-in image generator.
- Title & subtitle — add a clear title and optional subtitle.
- Post body — below the subtitle, start to write the body of your post.

## Cover image guidelines & best practices

Cover images help your post stand out across Paragraph, Farcaster, and beyond. Follow these guidelines to ensure your images display correctly and look great everywhere.

### **Recommended dimensions**

- Ideal aspect ratio: 2:1
- Recommended size: 2000 × 1000 px
- Minimum size: 844 × 422 px

Images smaller than 844 × 422 px may appear pixelated or blurry on larger screens.

### **Cropping and display**

Paragraph enforces a consistent 2:1 crop across the platform. The image is centered automatically and adapts slightly between desktop and mobile views.

To ensure important details aren’t cut off:

- Keep key elements (faces, text, focal points) within the center 60–70% of the image.
- Avoid placing text or critical details near the top or bottom edges.
- Test your image on both desktop and mobile if possible.

### **File Format**

- Use high-quality PNG or JPEG files.
- Avoid transparent backgrounds.
- Keep file sizes under 5 MB for best performance.

### **Design Tips**

- Choose simple, high-contrast visuals that work in both light and dark modes.
- If including text, place it near the lower third of the image with generous margins.
- Avoid overly detailed or busy imagery that doesn’t scale well to small previews.
