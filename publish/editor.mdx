The Paragraph editor is designed for writers: fast, distraction-free, and built for long-form publishing. You can draft, format, and enhance your posts with embeds and interactive blocks, then preview and publish with ease.

To open the editor, click “New post” from your dashboard.

This guide will help you go from a blank page to a published post, including tips on drafting, editing, and formatting along the way.

## Start your draft

- Cover image — drag an image onto the cover area, click to upload, or generate a cover image using our built-in image generator.
- Title & subtitle — add a clear title and optional subtitle.
- Post body — below the subtitle, start to write the body of your post.

- Formatting: headings, bullets, numbered lists, quotes, dividers, callouts.
- Rich blocks: images, tables, code blocks, collapsible sections, inline equations.
- Embeds: X posts, YouTube, and generic embeds.
- Action buttons: subscribe button, share button, or add a custom button.

  Tip: You can also type to search within the / menu (e.g., /image, /quote, /youtube).
