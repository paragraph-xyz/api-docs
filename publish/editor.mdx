# Write and publish with the editor

After you click "New post", you will be taken to Paragraph's editor, which lets you write, format, and enrich posts with embeds and interactive blocks, then preview & publish with ease.

Paragraph’s editor is fast, distraction-free, and built for long-form writing. It autosaves as you type and lets you add rich blocks with a simple command.

Here's a quick overview of Paragraph's editor and how to write & publish a post.

## Start your draft

- Cover image — drag an image onto the cover area, click to upload, or generate a cover image using our built-in image generator.
- Title & subtitle — add a clear title and optional subtitle.
- Post body — below the subtitle, start to write the body of your post.

## Compose with “/”

Type / anywhere to open the command menu and insert blocks:

- Formatting: headings, bullets, numbered lists, quotes, dividers, callouts.
- Rich blocks: images, tables, code blocks, collapsible sections, inline equations.
- Embeds: X posts, YouTube, and generic embeds.
- Action buttons: subscribe button, share button, or add a custom button.

  Tip: You can also type to search within the / menu (e.g., /image, /quote, /youtube).
