# Authentication

The Paragraph API uses API keys for authentication. Some endpoints are public and don't require authentication, while others require an API key.

## Getting an API Key

1. Go to your [Paragraph Dashboard](https://paragraph.com)
2. Navigate to Settings > Developer
3. Generate a new API key
4. Store it securely - it won't be shown again

## Using Your API Key

### With the SDK

```typescript
import { ParagraphSDK } from '@paragraph/sdk';

const sdk = new ParagraphSDK({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key-here',
  baseURL: 'https://api.paragraph.com/api'
});
```

### With HTTP Requests

Include your API key in the `x-api-key` header:

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: your-api-key-here" \
  https://api.paragraph.com/api/v1/publications/your-pub-id
```

## Public Endpoints

These endpoints don't require authentication:

- `GET /v1/publications/{id}`
- `GET /v1/publications/slug/{slug}`
- `GET /v1/publications/domain/{domain}`
- `GET /v1/posts/{id}`
- `GET /v1/users/{id}`
- `GET /v1/coins/{address}`

## Rate Limiting

- **Unauthenticated requests**: 100 requests per minute per IP
- **Authenticated requests**: 1000 requests per minute per API key
